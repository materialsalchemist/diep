# Introduction

This directory contains pre-trained MatGL models. They serve two purposes:

1. To serve as default models for users to perform property predictions.
2. To serve as baseline models for developers to build on.

The naming of the model folders follows the format `<model_name>-<training dataset>-<property>`.
Please refer to the READMEs in the respective model directory for details.
