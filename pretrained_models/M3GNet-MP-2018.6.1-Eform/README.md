# Aim

This model is a M3GNet formation energy model for 89 elements of the periodic table. It contains the formation
energy for most materials. This is essentially a retrained version of the M3GNet formation energy model
originally implemented in tensorflow.

# Training dataset

MP-2018.6.1: Materials Project formation energy as of 2018.6.1.
- Training set size: : 62315
- Validation set size: 3461
- Test set size: 3463

# Performance metrics

MAE of formation energy in eV/atom.
- Training: 0.007 eV/atom
- Validation: 0.019 eV/atom
- Test: 0.019 eV/atom
